<h1 align="center">Major Weather Hacking</h1>
We're using the OpenWeather API to get weather data on different cities. Your challenge over the next 2 weeks is to build out this website and add even more functionality to it. At the moment, it displays basic information about a location when you type it in. Check out Issues for some more ideas!

You'll need to get your own API Key from their website (for free) and add it as an environment variable in a .env file. We have a template available as example.env.

You'll be using React initially to build this. If you're new to React, check out the website for some information on getting started!

## Installation
1. Fork & Clone the Repository
2. Check whether you have `Node` installed on your system `node --v`
3. Create a `.env` file with your API keys
4. Install the dependencies with `npm install`
5. Run the project with `npm start`
